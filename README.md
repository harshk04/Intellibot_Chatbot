# Intellibot

Intellibot is an AI-powered chatbot developed using Python, trained on English language data from various fields. It is designed to provide intelligent responses and engage in natural language conversations across different domains.

## Features
**Natural language understanding:** Intellibot leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to comprehend user queries and extract their meaning.
**Intent recognition:** The chatbot employs machine learning algorithms to recognize the intent behind user inputs, enabling it to generate contextually relevant responses.
**Multiple domains:** Intellibot is trained on training data from diverse fields such as technology, finance, healthcare, and more, allowing it to handle a wide range of topics.
**Customizable:** The chatbot's behavior can be customized by modifying the training data and fine-tuning the underlying machine learning model.

## Dependencies
To run Intellibot, you need the following dependencies:
Python (version 3.7 or higher)
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

`pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas numpy`

## Usage
To use Intellibot, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/your_username/intellibot.git`

Navigate to the project directory:
`cd intellibot`

Run the chatbot:
`python chatbot.py`

Start interacting with Intellibot in the terminal. Enter your queries, and the chatbot will provide responses based on its training data.


## Training Data
Intellibot's training data is a collection of query-response pairs from various fields. The data includes examples related to technology, finance, healthcare, and other domains. This diverse training data helps the chatbot understand and respond effectively to user queries.

You can customize the training data by modifying the `english/` file included in the repository. You can add more query-response pairs or modify existing ones to tailor the chatbot's knowledge and improve its performance.

## Customization
Intellibot offers several customization options to enhance its performance and adapt it to specific requirements. Here are a few ways to customize the chatbot:

**Training data:** Update the training_data.csv file with domain-specific query-response pairs to improve the chatbot's understanding in a particular field.
**Model selection:** Experiment with different machine learning models or algorithms to find the one that best suits your needs. Adjust the model parameters accordingly.
**Preprocessing:** Modify the preprocessing steps, such as tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization, to optimize the chatbot's understanding and response generation.

Feel free to explore these customization options to make Intellibot more effective and tailored to your specific use case.
